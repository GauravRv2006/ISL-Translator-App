# ISL Translator App  

## 📌 About the Project  
The **Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator App** is designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and non-deaf individuals. This app provides real-time translation between spoken language and ISL using AI-powered sign recognition and avatar-based sign rendering.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Speech-to-ISL Translation**: Converts spoken sentences into ISL using a virtual avatar or visual display.  
- **ISL-to-Text/Speech Translation**: Uses a camera to recognize ISL gestures and translates them into text or speech.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensures smooth and fast communication.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for accessibility and ease of use.  

## 🔧 Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend AI models)  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for sign recognition  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV/MediaPipe for gesture recognition  
- **Frontend**: React/Flutter (if applicable)  
- **Backend**: Flask/Django for API services
